Ever curious to learn something new, I get excited when someone proves me wrong. This means I have learnt something new and I find this the most important skill in life. I want to improve myself 1% every day which means 37% improvement in a year which is much better than trying to push oneself too hard and burning out.

When I am not coding, you can find me running trail or playing table tennis at the local gym.
