My job as Data Scientist at GooHoo is quite open-ended. Being a fairly new young company from the perspective of Data Science, I am responsible for laying out the architecture needed for all processes. However, I am still a student so by researching the best-practices around Data Science, my task now revolves around the following points -

 Researching on financial time series forecasting focusing on Retail and Operations management.

* Create data pipelines to process and transform data from different sources.

* Create dashboards in Shiny to provide actionable business insights.

* Create algorithm for dynamically pricing multiple products.


Technologies used : R, Python, Shiny, Docker, AWS

**Product Manager** - **[EyeSense](https://www.eye-sense.com/)** <span style="float: right; ">Feb 2018 - Aug 2018 (7 mos)</span>

This internship was a unique experience for me because my target clients were blind or visually impaired. This demanded me to think about solutions in creative manner. For example a simple side bar menu is not a side bar at all. My day to day task at EyeSense revolved around the following points:

* Create proper data flow from customer to developers by listening to user's need and translating them to the developers.

* Monitor user's interaction with the app to gain knowledge about HCI (Human-computer-Interaction) elements which can be removed or added.

* Report weekly data analysis about the user experience


Technologies used : Google analytics, Automated emails with Mailgun, Bitly



**Web Integration Developer** - **[WYND](https://www.wynd.eu/)** <span style="float: right; ">Nov 2015 - May 2016 (7 mos)</span>

WYND is a startup focusing on digitizing POS system.  My role in WYND was to API framework for multitude of mobile devices to communicate in real-time without stressing the server or being too costly. Therefore, my approach

* Investigating, proposing and providing solutions for cheaper communication between remote autonomous payment devices. With my provided solution WYND could have saved 60% on mobile data usage.

* Extensive API development and Symfony2 integration along with SlimAPI platform and providing detail on usage of the API.

* Testing system architecture and server management and migration

I stopped working at WYND because I had to move from Paris to Nijmegen for my study.

### EDUCATION

**Radboud University**, Njmegen <span style="float: right; ">2016-Present</span> <br />
*Bachelors of Sc. Artificial Intelligence*

Intensive bachelors study that combines Psychology, Cognitive Science, Computer Science and Mathematics together to mold a holistic approach to Artificial Intelligence. Along with building Neural Networks, I was asked to question the ethical perspective of AI to our modern society.


**Ullens School**, Kathmandu  <span style="float: right; ">2015-2016</span>

Two years of rigorous Baccalaureate course that incorporates subjects like CAS and TOK.  To be eligible for the diploma, I wrote  a 4000 word research paper on the topic : Efficiency of operational amplifier


### Voluntter experience

**CoderDojo**, Njmegen <span style="float: right; ">2018-Present</span> <br />
*Mentor*

Every first Sunday of the month, I mentor teach kids between the ages of 7 and 16 during the coderdojo sessions.


**HimalayanDisaster**, Kathmandu  <span style="float: right; ">2014</span>

After the destructive 7.8M earthquake that hit Nepal on 12th May 2015, relief material being quickly being distributed to the affected villages of Nepal but there was not a system present to keep track of those relief work. These created a problem as there was no way to check the hotspot for relief.
We created a data collection and visualization platform to keep track of these relief measures. This helped the organizations and volunteering groups of people to take better decisions.
 The system is is fully open source and can be found in [github](https://github.com/mshrestha/himalayandisaster).
