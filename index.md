### Hi! // नमस्ते! // Welkom!

<img class="circularimage" src="/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="Samarpan's portrait"  />
I am Samarpan Rai! Thank you for visiting my site. I am currently a fourth year Bachelors student studying A.I at Radboud University in Nijmegen (Netherlands).




I was born in the foothills of the Himalayas and now working on the lowest country (altitude wise) in the world. What a jump!

I am always curious about everything so I have worked in projects ranging from embedded circuit development for a creative agency in Kathmandu (Nepal), API Developer for a startup company in Paris (France) to a Product Manager for a startup company in Nijmegen (Netherlands).

I believe failure is the best teacher. I strive fail fast and learn quick in this ever changing world of technology. But what is failure without reflecting on them ? That's why I created this blog to record my learnings and show case my work in this website. I hope you will find it fun to read as much as I had fun in writing them. You can also find my CV <a href="/resume/"> here </a>.

If you have any questions, inquiry or just want to say then feel free to write me <a href = "mailto: samarpan-rai@live.com">here</a>
