### Hi! // नमस्ते! // Welkom!

<img class="circularimage" src="/assets/img/me.jpg" alt="Samarpan's portrait"  />

My name is Samarpan Rai! My area of interests are Artificial intelligence, web development and hardware development.

I am always curious about everything so I have worked in projects ranging from embedded circuit development for a creative agency in Kathmandu (Nepal), API Developer for a startup company in Paris (France) to a Product Manager for a startup company in Nijmegen (Netherlands).

I believe failure is the best teacher. I strive to fail fast and learn quick in this ever changing world of technology. But what is failure without reflecting on them ? That's why I created this blog to record my learnings and record my learnings. I hope you will find it fun to read as much as I had fun in writing them.


If you have any questions, inquiry or just want to say then feel free to write me <a href = "mailto: samarpan-rai@live.com">here</a>
